## Predicting Daily Hubway Ridership

This project aims to predict the number of daily rides taken each day using Hubway, the bicycle sharing system in the Boston, Massachusetts metro area. The system is owned and operated by the cities of Boston and Cambridge and has changed the transportation landscape in the city. The bikes have become a common feature on the daily commute as well as the weekend adventure. Despite its ubiquitousness, the system still faces many challenges, including more accurate prediction sources for user ease of use, redistribution of bikes when docks become full or empty, and bikeshare availability during the winter.

Hubway ridership trends depend upon time of day, time of week, seasonality, commute patterns, weather, and holidays. The study begins with scraping relevant ridership datasets from the Hubway Challenge website, the Hubway Tracker, and climatological data for the months January to December of 2016. After some exploratory data analyses, this study explores three predictive algorithms: multiple linear regression, random forest ensemble, and gradient boosting.
